index.php?c=something&m=something, in this c is the controller to call and m is the method. Is "m" the method inside the controller to call?

if we are determining the controller and method on the fly based on the GET arguments in index.php, then how are we going to use requre_once() if we don't know which controller file to import??
In that case, isn't autoloader the only option??

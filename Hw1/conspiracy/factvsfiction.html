<!--Each of your pages must also have an unordered list on it, a span tag, an img tag, and a table tag. The link for the image should be relative and the image file should be a png. Use the span tag to give a tooltip suggestion over some bold-faced text to reveal some extra-spooky, additional conspiracy information. Use tables with two columns: one for the "truth" and one for what "they" would have you believe. You should use a link tag to specify a favicon. Other than these requirements, be creative, and have fun making this site. Also, keep the conspiracies light-hearted.-->

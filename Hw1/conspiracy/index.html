<!--Each of your pages must also have an unordered list on it, a span tag, an img tag, and a table tag. The link for the image should be relative and the image file should be a png. Use the span tag to give a tooltip suggestion over some bold-faced text to reveal some extra-spooky, additional conspiracy information. Use tables with two columns: one for the "truth" and one for what "they" would have you believe. You should use a link tag to specify a favicon. Other than these requirements, be creative, and have fun making this site. Also, keep the conspiracies light-hearted.-->

                    <p style="font-size: 16pt;">Area 51 is one of the most restricted location on earth. The government kept it a secret and tried to cover up the related incidents as much as possible, but truth finally surfaced. It is allegedly a military base located in Southern Nevada 100 miles north of Las Vegas. But we have evidence and witnesses that proves the remains of crashed UFO spacecrafts are stored at Area 51, a secret, highly classified military base about 150 miles from Las Vegas, where government scientists reverse-engineer the aliens' highly advanced technology. Thats where they innovated the Stealth fighter and Kevlar. <span title="Misterious lights are seen over Area 51 which is a direct evidence of extraterrestial activity"><b>UFO sightings</b></span> in the area and testimony from a retired <span title="Philip James Corso (May 22, 1915 - July 16, 1998) was an American Army officer."><b><a href="#bigreveal">Army colonel</a></b></span> confirms he was given access to extraterrestrial materials gathered from an alien spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, N.M. The government has developed advanced aircraft and weapons systems at nearby Nellis Air Force Base, including Stealth bombers and reconnaissance planes. They keep saying that the details of Area 51 are classified for purposes of national security - which supports the fact that the military is hiding aliens or alien spacecraft.</p>

        <p style="font-size:16pt;">All specifics regarding the facility and the projects housed there are classified. What is known is the Air Force, the CIA and Lockheed have used the base as a staging ground for test flights of experimental, secret aircraft, also known as black aircraft. The base served as the development and testing facility for cutting edge aircraft technology from the U-2 spy plane to the F-117A Stealth Fighter. Where did all this innovations and ideas came from. These are results of the extraterrestial knowledge. It shows that the aliens are far more technologically advanced and we are in great danger.</p>

                 Bob (born January 26, 1959) claims to have worked on reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology at a site called S4, in the Emigrant Valley and Old Kelley Mine area near the Area 51 test facility. The governmenr tried to discredit him by removing his records from Universities and falsely accusing him for petty crimes.

                <h4>Boyd Bushman</h4>
                A dying scientist has made a deathbed confession about what is really going on at Nevada’s mysterious Area 51. He reveals that he reverse-engineered flying saucer technology for defence firm Lockheed Martin. Boyd Bushman made the revelations in a video recorded just before he died in August,2014 – along with evidence in form of photographs of aliens taken on disposable cameras within the facility.

Use tables with two columns: one for the "truth" and one for what "they" would have you believe. You should use a link tag to specify a favicon. Other than these requirements, be creative, and have fun making this site. Also, keep the conspiracies light-hearted.-->

            <p>Area 51 is one of the most restricted
              locations on earth. The government had kept it a secret and tried
              to cover up the related incidents as much as possible, but truth
              has finally surfaced. It is allegedly a secret, highly classified
              military base about 150 miles from Las Vegas. But, we have
              evidence and witnesses proving that the remains of crashed UFO
              spacecrafts are stored at Area 51, where government scientists
              reverse-engineer the aliens' highly advanced technology. That is
              where they innovated the Stealth fighter and Kevlar. <span title="Mysterious lights are seen over Area 51 which is a direct evidence of extraterrestial activity"><b>UFO

              alien spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, N.M. The government has
              developed advanced aircraft and weapons systems at nearby Nellis
              Air Force Base, including Stealth bombers and reconnaissance
              planes. They keep saying that the details of Area 51 are
              classified for purposes of national security - which supports the
              fact that the military is hiding aliens or alien spacecraft.</p>

    <p>All specifics regarding the facility and the
      projects housed there are classified. What is known is that the Air Force,
      the CIA and Lockheed have used the base as a staging ground for test
      flights of experimental secret aircraft, also known as black aircraft. The
      base served as the development and testing facility for cutting edge
      aircraft technology from the U-2 spy plane to the F-117A Stealth Fighter.
      Where did all these innovations and ideas come from ?. These are results
      of the extraterrestial knowledge. It shows that the aliens are far more
      technologically advanced and we are in great danger.</p>

        He was a Lieutenant Colonel who served United States Army from February
        23, 1942, to March 1, 1963 claims to have worked in area 51. He
        published a book about how he was involved in the research of
        extraterrestrial technology recovered from the 1947 <span title="The Roswell UFO incident refers to an event in mid 1947, when a UFO crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico"><b>Roswell

        <h3>Robert Scott "Bob" Lazar</h3>
        Bob (born January 26, 1959) claims to have worked on reverse engineering
        extraterrestrial technology at a site called S4, in the Emigrant Valley
        and Old Kelley Mine area near the Area 51 test facility. The government
        tried to discredit him by removing his records from Universities and
        falsely accusing him for petty crimes. </li>

        <h3>Boyd Bushman</h3>
        A dying scientist has made a deathbed confession about what is really
        going on at Nevada’s mysterious Area 51. He reveals that he
        reverse-engineered flying saucer technology for defence firm Lockheed
        Martin. Boyd Bushman made the revelations in a video recorded just
        before he died in August,2014 – along with evidence in form of
        photographs of aliens taken on disposable cameras within the facility. </li>
